    <p>During the time of the Dacians, the settlement was called Napoca, a Thraco-Scythian name. It was also preserved by the Romans who erected it in 124 AD. at the rank of municipium ("Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca") on the occasion of the visit made by Emperor Hadrian (January 24, 76 - July 10, 138) in Dacia.</p>
    <p>In 129, Hadrian divided Dacia into Dacia Superior, Dacia Inferior and Dacia Porolissensis. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius divided the province of Dacia into three administrative regions: Porolissensis, with the capital at Porolissum, Apulensis with the capital at Apulum and Malvensis with the capital at Malva.</p>
    <p>The city of Napoca was founded by the emperor Hadrian. The name Napoca is definitely of Dacian origin, but the location of the Dacian settlement has not yet been identified in the field. The municipality was called municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocensis. Its citizens were part of the Sergia tribe.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor of the Romanian province Dacia Porolissensis established his residence in Napoca for a while, during which the province gained a special rise and prosperity. Marcus Aurelius was also the one who raised the settlement to the rank of a colony ("Colonia Aurelia Napoca"). From Septimius Severus he receives ius Italicum.</p>
    <p>Napoca experienced significant development during the Roman rule due to its strategic location on the Roman road from Apulum to Porolissum.</p>
    <p>Cluj was documented for the first time in 1173[1], with the name of Clus, and then with the name of Castrum Clus (1175) or Castrenses de Clus (1213). Clus derives from the Latin word clivus which means hill, hill. Another hypothesis that could explain the name of Cluj also refers to a Latin word, "clusa", which indicates a gorge, a narrow place between mountains or hills.</p>
    <p>The city was completely destroyed during the Tatar attack in 1241 and rebuilt with difficulty. It was the period when the royalty brought German settlers from the Rhineland and Saxony to Cluj. In 1316 Carol Robert raised the city to the rank of civitas, giving it wide privileges. The Romano-German Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg granted the townspeople the right to erect fortifications in 1405, and as such the town was surrounded by strong walls, equipped with towers and bastions. Some of them are still preserved today.</p>
    <p>During the uprising in Bobâlna from 1437-1438, the poor inhabitants of the city made common cause with the revolted peasants. From among them Ioan, the son of the master Iacob, rose up, one of the leaders of the uprising. During the uprising of 1514 led by Gheorghe Doja, the poor townspeople opened the city gates to the rebellious peasants led by Popa Laurentiu. The repression was bloody, and the leaders of the uprising were burned at the stake near the town.</p>
    <p>The 15th century and the first part of the 16th century was a period of prosperity for the city. Numerous edifices were erected in the Gothic or Renaissance style, when the crafts were highly developed.</p>
    <p>In 1541, following the transformation of the center of Hungary into a pashalac, Transylvania became an autonomous principality under the suzerainty of Portia, and Cluj remained the most important economic, political and cultural center of Transylvania.</p>
    <p>Throughout the ages, the city has been rich in cultural activity. In 1550 a large printing house was established which belonged to the author, publisher and printer Kaspar Helth. In the house that housed the printing house, the Heltai house, in 1557, Ștefan (István) Bocskai, one of the greatest princes of Transylvania, the only prince born in Cluj, was born. In 1581, an academy with three faculties opened its courses in the Franciscan monastery: theological, philosophical and legal.</p>
    <p>In 1601 Mihai the Brave entered the city gate, shortly after he had declared himself lord of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania. After 1688 Transylvania came under Habsburg rule, and in 1711 under Austrian rule.</p>
    <p>The city was devastated by great fires in 1601, 1655 and 1697, and in 1719 it was hit by an epidemic of plague.</p>
    <p>With the establishment of the College of Piarists in 1776, the city experienced a new era of cultural flourishing due to the fact that four faculties were operating here: philosophy, natural sciences, law and surgery. People of culture such as Ioan Piuariu Molnar, the first Romanian doctor representing the Enlightenment, worked here and studied Gheorghe Șincai, Petru Maior, Gheorghe Lazăr, Gheorghe Barițiu and Avram Iancu.</p>
    <p>On March 19, 1848, a revolutionary demonstration took place in Cluj in which intellectuals, students, workers, small craftsmen, Romanian and Hungarian serf peasants took part. Simion Bărnutiu's proclamation calling for the fight for social justice and national freedom had a wide echo in the souls of the people of Cluj, as did the program adopted at the great assembly held in Blaj on May 15-17. The Diet of Cluj defied this enthusiastic desire of the urban mass to adhere to the principles of the program of the revolution, and on May 18, 1848, it voted for the union of Transylvania with Hungary.</p>
    <p>In 1918, Cluj was gripped by the revolutionary turmoil that preceded the act of December 1. The people of Cluj participated in the National Assembly in Alba Iulia that fulfilled the union. Following the Treaty of Vienna in 1940, the northern part of Transylvania was handed over to Horthy Hungary. On October 11, 1944, Romanian and German troops liberated Cluj, repelling the Hungarian and German troops that controlled the city. Cluj once again became part of Romania following the Treaty of Paris in 1947.</p>
    <p>From 1945 to 1989 Cluj went through a period of communist rule, and in 1974 the name of the city was changed to Cluj-Napoca.</p>
    <p>Cluj-Napoca was the second important point of the Romanian Revolution from 17-22 December 1989. The revolution in Cluj-Napoca began on 21 December 1989 at 15:34 in Piaţa Păcii, today Piaţa Revoluţiei, at the intersection with Napoca street , University Street and Petru Groza Boulevard, today Heroes' Boulevard.</p>
